# Lesson 17 - Gradient and pattern

In this lesson, we'll explore how to implement gradients and repeating patterns.

-   Use CanvasGradient to implement gradients
    -   Imperative. Create textures using the Device API
    -   Declarative. Supports CSS gradient syntax: `linear-gradient`, `radial-gradient`, `conic-gradient`
    -   Use Shoelace to implement gradient configuration panel
-   Use Shader to implement Mesh Gradient
    -   Simulate random
    -   Value Noise and Gradient Noise
    -   Voronoi, FBM and Domain Warping
-   Export SVG
-   Use CanvasPattern to implement repeating patterns

## Use CanvasGradient {#canvas-gradient}

We can use the [CanvasGradient] API to create various gradient effects, which can then be consumed as textures. We'll introduce both imperative and declarative implementations.

### Creating Gradient Textures Imperatively {#create-gradient-texture}

Taking linear gradient as an example, after creating a `<canvas>` and getting its context, [createLinearGradient] requires start and end points that define the gradient's direction. Then add multiple color stops, draw to the `<canvas>`, and use it as a source for creating textures:

```ts
const gradient = ctx.createLinearGradient(0, 0, 1, 0); // x1, y1, x2, y2

gradient.addColorStop(0, 'red');
gradient.addColorStop(1, 'blue');

ctx.fillStyle = gradient;
ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 256, 1);
```

Create a texture object using the [Device] API, and finally pass it to the shape's `fill` property to complete the drawing.

```ts
// 0. Create gradient data
const ramp = generateColorRamp({
    colors: [
        '#FF4818',
        '#F7B74A',
        '#FFF598',
        '#91EABC',
        '#2EA9A1',
        '#206C7C',
    ].reverse(),
    positions: [0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0],
});

// 1. Get canvas device
const device = canvas.getDevice();

// 2. Create texture object
const texture = device.createTexture({
    format: Format.U8_RGBA_NORM,
    width: ramp.width,
    height: ramp.height,
    usage: TextureUsage.SAMPLED,
});
texture.setImageData([ramp.data]); // Pass the previously created <canvas> data to texture

// 3. Pass the texture object to the shape's `fill` property
rect.fill = { texture };
```

<Gradient />

However, we want to support declarative syntax to improve usability and facilitate serialization.

### Declarative CSS Gradient Syntax {#css-gradient-syntax}

Following CSS gradient syntax, we can use [gradient-parser] to obtain structured results, which can then be used to call APIs like [createLinearGradient]:

```ts
rect.fill = 'linear-gradient(0deg, blue, green 40%, red)';
rect.fill = 'radial-gradient(circle at center, red, blue, green 100%)';
```

The parsing results are as follows:

```js eval code=false
linearGradient = call(() => {
    const { parseGradient } = Core;
    return parseGradient('linear-gradient(0deg, blue, green 40%, red)');
});
```

```js eval code=false
radialGradient = call(() => {
    const { parseGradient } = Core;
    return parseGradient(
        'radial-gradient(circle at center, red, blue, green 100%)',
    );
});
```

There are several common gradient types, and we currently support the first three:

-   [linear-gradient] Supported by CSS and Canvas
-   [radial-gradient] Supported by CSS and Canvas
-   [conic-gradient] Supported by CSS and Canvas
-   [repeating-linear-gradient] Supported by CSS, can be hacked with Canvas, see [How to make a repeating CanvasGradient]
-   [repeating-radial-gradient] Supported by CSS
-   [sweep-gradient] Supported in CanvasKit / Skia

<DeclarativeGradient />

Additionally, we support overlaying multiple gradients, for example:

```ts
rect.fill = `linear-gradient(217deg, rgba(255,0,0,.8), rgba(255,0,0,0) 70.71%),
    linear-gradient(127deg, rgba(0,255,0,.8), rgba(0,255,0,0) 70.71%),
    linear-gradient(336deg, rgba(0,0,255,.8), rgba(0,0,255,0) 70.71%)`;
```

### Gradient Editor Panel {#gradient-editor}

Inspired by Figma's gradient editing panel, we've implemented a similar editor. You can trigger the editing panel by selecting a shape in the example above.

![Figma gradient panel](/figma-gradient-panel.png)

## Implementing Gradients with Mesh {#mesh-gradient}

The gradients implemented based on Canvas and SVG have limited expressiveness and cannot display complex effects. Some design tools like Sketch / Figma have many Mesh-based implementations in their communities, such as:

-   [Mesh gradients plugin for Sketch]
-   [Mesh Gradient plugin for Figma]
-   [Photo gradient plugin for Figma]
-   [Noise & Texture plugin for Figma]

We referenced some open-source implementations, some implemented in Vertex Shader, others in Fragment Shader. We chose the latter:

-   [meshgradient]
-   [Mesh gradient generator]
-   [react-mesh-gradient]

<MeshGradient />

Due to WebGL1 GLSL100 syntax compatibility, we need to avoid using `switch`, otherwise we'll get errors like:

> [!CAUTION]
> ERROR: 0:78: 'switch' : Illegal use of reserved word

Also, in `for` loops, we cannot use Uniform as the termination condition for `index`:

> [!CAUTION]
> ERROR: 0:87: 'i' : Loop index cannot be compared with non-constant expression

Therefore, we can only use constant `MAX_POINTS` to limit loop iterations, similar to Three.js chunks handling light sources:

```glsl
#define MAX_POINTS 10

for (int i = 0; i < MAX_POINTS; i++) {
    if (i < int(u_PointsNum)) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Now let's dive into the details of Shaders. You can refer to [The Book of Shaders - Generative Design] to learn more details.

### Random {#random}

To implement noise effects, we need a random function. However, GLSL does not have a built-in `random` function, so we need to simulate this behavior. Since it's a simulation, for the same `random(x)`, we always get the same return value, so it's a pseudo-random number.

If we want to get a `random` function that returns a value between 0 and 1, we can use `y = fract(sin(x)*1.0);`, which only retains the decimal part.

![y = fract(sin(x)*1.0)](https://xiaoiver.github.io/assets/img/resized/480/tbs-rand1.png)

Observing this function, we can find that if we reduce the period to be extremely short, the values corresponding to the same x can be considered approximately random (pseudo-random). The specific method is to increase the coefficient, for example `y = fract(sin(x)*10.0);`.

![y = fract(sin(x)*10.0)](https://xiaoiver.github.io/assets/img/resized/480/tbs-rand2.png)

Further increasing to 100000, we can no longer distinguish the waveform of `sin`. It's important to note again that unlike `Math.random()` in JS, this method is deterministic random, and its essence is actually a hash function.

We need to apply the `random` function to a 2D scene, where the input changes from a single `x` to an `xy` coordinate. We need to map the 2D vector to a single value. The book of shaders uses the `dot` built-in function to multiply a specific vector, but it doesn't explain why.

```glsl
float random (vec2 st) {
    return fract(sin(
        dot(st.xy,vec2(12.9898,78.233)))*
        43758.5453123);
}
```

After searching online, we found this answer [What's the origin of this GLSL rand() one-liner?]ã€‚It's said that it originally came from a paper, and there's no explanation for why the three Magic Numbers are chosen. Anyway, the generated effect is good, similar to the "snow screen" of a black and white TV. You can see this effect by increasing the `NoiseRatio` in the example above.

### Value noise {#value-noise}

Using our defined `random` function, and `floor`, we can get a step-like function.

```glsl
float i = floor(x);
y = random(i);
```

![step](https://xiaoiver.github.io/assets/img/webgl/tbs-noise1.png)

If we want to interpolate between adjacent "steps", we can use a linear function or a smooth interpolation function `smoothstep`:

```glsl
float i = floor(x);
float f = fract(x);
y = mix(rand(i), rand(i + 1.0), f);
// y = mix(rand(i), rand(i + 1.0), smoothstep(0.,1.,f));
```

![smoothstep](https://xiaoiver.github.io/assets/img/webgl/tbs-noise2.png)

In one dimension, we chose `i+1`, and in two dimensions, we can choose the 4 adjacent points. The corresponding mixing function also needs to be modified. The mixing function in the original text is the expanded form, which is a bit difficult to understand, but the benefit is that it calls `mix` twice less.

```glsl
float noise (in vec2 st) {
    vec2 i = floor(st);
    vec2 f = fract(st);

    // Four corners in 2D of a tile
    float a = random(i);
    float b = random(i + vec2(1.0, 0.0));
    float c = random(i + vec2(0.0, 1.0));
    float d = random(i + vec2(1.0, 1.0));

    vec2 u = smoothstep(0.,1.,f);

    // Mix 4 coorners percentages
    return mix(a, b, u.x) +
            (c - a)* u.y * (1.0 - u.x) +
            (d - b) * u.x * u.y;

    // It's actually the expanded form below
    return mix( mix( a, b , u.x),
                mix( c, d, u.x), u.y);
}
```

The above method of generating noise is interpolation between random values, so it's called "value noise". Carefully observing it, we can find that this method generates results with obvious blocky traces, such as the left part in the example below.

### Gradient noise {#gradient-noise}

> In 1985, Ken Perlin developed another noise algorithm called Gradient Noise. Ken solved how to insert random gradients (gradients, gradients) instead of a fixed value. These gradient values come from a two-dimensional random function, which returns a direction (a vector in vec2 format) instead of a single value (float format).

The specific algorithm is as follows, and the biggest difference from value noise is the use of `dot` to interpolate the four directions:

```glsl
float noise( in vec2 st ) {
    vec2 i = floor(st);
    vec2 f = fract(st);

 vec2 u = smoothstep(0., 1., f);

    return mix( mix( dot( random( i + vec2(0.0,0.0) ), f - vec2(0.0,0.0) ),
                     dot( random( i + vec2(1.0,0.0) ), f - vec2(1.0,0.0) ), u.x),
                mix( dot( random( i + vec2(0.0,1.0) ), f - vec2(0.0,1.0) ),
                     dot( random( i + vec2(1.0,1.0) ), f - vec2(1.0,1.0) ), u.x), u.y);
}
```

> For Ken Perlin, the success of his algorithm was far from enough. He felt it could be better. At the Siggraph in 2001, he showed "simplex noise".

The specific implementation can be found in: [2d-snoise-clear], and there's also a 3D version.

### Voronoi noise {#voronoi-noise}

We already learned how to divide space into small grid areas in the "Drawing Pattern" section. We can generate a random feature point for each grid, and for a fragment within a grid, we only need to calculate the minimum distance to the feature points in the 8 adjacent grids, which greatly reduces the amount of computation. This is the main idea of Steven Worley's paper.

The random feature points use the `random` method we learned earlier, since it's deterministic random, the feature points within each grid are fixed.

```glsl
// Divide the grid
vec2 i_st = floor(st);
vec2 f_st = fract(st);
float m_dist = 1.;
// 8 directions
for (int y= -1; y <= 1; y++) {
    for (int x= -1; x <= 1; x++) {
        // Current adjacent grid
        vec2 neighbor = vec2(float(x),float(y));
        // Feature point in adjacent grid
        vec2 point = random2(i_st + neighbor);
        // Distance from fragment to feature point
        vec2 diff = neighbor + point - f_st;
        float dist = length(diff);
        // Save the minimum value
        m_dist = min(m_dist, dist);
    }
}
color += m_dist;
```

<Voronoi />

The voronoi noise implementation based on this idea can be found in [lygia/generative].

### fBM {#fbm}

See [Inigo Quilez's fBM], the `noise` can be value noise or gradient noise:

> So we are going to use some standard fBM (Fractional Brownian Motion) which is a simple sum of noise waves with increasing frequencies and decreasing amplitudes.

The original text also explains in detail the reason for using `gain = 0.5`, which corresponds to `H = 1`. `H` reflects the "self-similarity" of the curve, used in procedural generation to simulate natural shapes like clouds, mountains, and oceans:

$$ G=2^{-H} $$

```glsl
const int octaves = 6;
float lacunarity = 2.0;
float gain = 0.5;

float amplitude = 0.5;
float frequency = 1.;

for (int i = 0; i < octaves; i++) {
 y += amplitude * noise(frequency*x);
 frequency *= lacunarity;
 amplitude *= gain;
}
```

<FractalBrownianMotion />

See [Inigo Quilez's Domain Warping] and [Mike Bostock's Domain Warping]. Call `fbm` recursively:

```glsl
f(p) = fbm( p )
f(p) = fbm( p + fbm( p ) )
f(p) = fbm( p + fbm( p + fbm( p )) )
```

<DomainWarping />

### Server-side rendering {#server-side-rendering}

Finally, let's explore server-side rendering, such as generating album covers on the server. In [Lesson 11 - Server-side rendering], we introduced `headless-gl`. Now we need to create a Lambda function on AWS that performs server-side rendering using a custom Layer containing `headless-gl`.

![aws-lambda-layer](/aws-lambda-layer.png)

Let's build the Layer locally using the Amazon Linux 2023 image, since our target runtime environment is Node.js 20.x:

```bash
docker run -it amazonlinux:2023 bash
```

Then run the following command in the container to install some dependencies required by `headless-gl`:

```bash
dnf update -y
dnf install -y git make gcc-c++ python3 mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libEGL-devel libX11-devel libXext-devel
curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash -
dnf install -y nodejs
```

Then create the layer directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/headless-gl-layer/nodejs
cd /opt/headless-gl-layer/nodejs
```

Then build and install from source:

```bash
npm install gl --build-from-source
```

Assuming your current directory is `/opt/headless-gl-layer`, execute:

```bash
cd /opt/headless-gl-layer
zip -r9 /opt/headless-gl-layer.zip .
```

Then upload to S3 to complete the creation of the layer:

```bash
aws lambda publish-layer-version \
  --layer-name headless-gl-layer \
  --description "Headless GL for Node.js on AL2 arm64" \
  --compatible-runtimes nodejs20.x \
  --compatible-architectures arm64 \
  --content S3Bucket=<your-bucket>,S3Key=headless-gl-layer.zip
```

You can now select this Layer in the AWS console to add it to your function.

## Implementing Patterns {#pattern}

We can use Canvas API's [createPattern] to create patterns, supporting the following syntax:

```ts
export interface Pattern {
    image: string | CanvasImageSource;
    repetition?: 'repeat' | 'repeat-x' | 'repeat-y' | 'no-repeat';
    transform?: string;
}

rect.fill = {
    image,
    repetition: 'repeat',
};
```

The string-based `transform` needs to be parsed into `mat3`, and then passed to [setTransform].

<Pattern />

## Exporting Gradients to SVG {#export-gradient-to-svg}

### Linear Gradient {#linear-gradient}

SVG provides [linearGradient] and [radialGradient], but their supported attributes are quite different from [CanvasGradient].

### Conic Gradient {#conic-gradient}

Refer to [SVG angular gradient] for an approximate implementation. The [CSS conic-gradient() polyfill] approach is to render using Canvas and export as dataURL, then reference it with `<image>`.

### Multiple Gradient Overlay {#multiple-gradient-overlay}

For multiple gradient overlays, in Canvas API, you can set `fillStyle` multiple times for overlaying. In declarative SVG, you can use multiple `<feBlend>` to achieve this.
