This tutorial covers a basic 2D graphics rendering implementation based on WebGL / WebGPU:

-   [Lesson 2 - Draw a circle]
-   [Lesson 5 - Grid]
-   [Lesson 9 - Drawing ellipse and rectangle]
-   [Lesson 12 - Draw polyline]
-   [Lesson 13 - Drawing path and sketchy style]
-   [Lesson 15 - Text rendering]
-   [Lesson 16 - Text advanced features]
-   [Lesson 25 - Drawing mode and brush]

Also includes UI components implemented using Web Components technology:

-   [Lesson 7 - Web UI]
-   [Lesson 18 - Refactor with ECS]
-   [Lesson 24 - Context menu and clipboard]

And some interesting topics:

-   [Lesson 17 - Gradient and pattern]
-   [Lesson 19 - History]
-   [Lesson 22 - VectorNetwork]

The most important thing:

-   [Lesson 28 - Integrating with AI]
